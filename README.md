To Do
=====

A simple To Do list application built using Angular, HTML and CSS.

The list displays the number of items remaining to be completed on the To Do list which also dynamically updates as you use it (thanks to Angulars data-binding).

You can add as many tasks as you want. You can also clear tasks that have been checked off.
